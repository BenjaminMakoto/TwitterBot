#NASA APOD Twitter Bot

This is a Bash Scrip that will tweet the *NASA Astronomy Photo Of the Day (APOD)"* at a given time.

It accomplishes this by setting the tweet time using a cron table.
The *NASA APOD* is retrieved each day using the NASA APOD api and the actual tweet is done using the Twitter API and twurl command.
